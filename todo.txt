*Make a START button and a RESTART button (this might fix the first Q problem?)

*If the start button doesn't fix it, figure out why the first question isn't loading

*Make the answer buttons stack vertically and look nice

*Caption the GIFs and make them all the same size

*Style the page to be more sci-fi-y
